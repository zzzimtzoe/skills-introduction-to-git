## Step 6: Introduction to Collaboration

Nice work! You've mastered local Git operations and our game is now safe to experiment developing new features! 🎉

But.. the really fun development happens in teams, not alone. That is another exercise, but let's start exploring the topic.

### 📖 Theory: Git Collaboration Concepts

Since branches provide powerful parallelism to work on different features independently, a natural extension is to enable multiple people to work in parallel.

At the beginning, we mentioned Git is a "distributed" version control system, this means it can share changes with other copies of the same repository!

### What does collaboration look like?

Here is a typical workflow:

1. Copy a repository to your local machine (called **cloning**).
1. Create branches and develop new features.
1. Publish your changes to a remote repository, somewhere others can also access (called **pushing**).
1. Other developers decide if they like your changes. If so, they merge them into their version of the project (called **pulling**).
1. Additionally, you might proactively ask another developer to integrate your changes into their copy (called a **pull request**).

Answer one quick question for Mona, and she will share the final review! 🎉

**What is your favorite feature of Git?**

- [ ] It's free and open source. 😍
- [ ] I don't need internet to use it. 🛜
- [ ] I can use it with any operating system. 🍎🪟🐧
- [ ] The detailed history (if I write good messages). ✨
- [ ] That I might never write `final_really.zip` ever again! 😎
